%%This is a small boilerplate for RUBY

It is inspired by the (article)[https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex46.html]. as of now it is executable under Linux Feadora.

Linux localhost.localdomain 4.18.8-200.fc28.x86_64 #1 SMP Sun Sep 16 18:15:41 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux


It does not work untder cygwin since the ruby installation seems to be broken.
